## 10/22/2025 6:21 PM - finding usb mux ic  

What I Did

i researched different manufacturers like infineon for their chips.
Next Steps

time to pick all of the parts for the ic to work :D
Issues Faced

the chips i found are usually ball pads and there are so much stuff to route lol. i found a good contender with qfn package for 4 port with integrated usb cc negotiations too :D

## 10/22/2025 6:22 PM - going with the GENESYS GL3523  


What I Did

after some more researching, this part can mux 1 usb port into 4, pretty nice and it doesnt have any pads under the package, which is extra nice
Next Steps

time to make the schematic!
