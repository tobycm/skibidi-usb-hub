## 10/22/2025 - finding usb mux ic  

What I Did

i researched different manufacturers like infineon for their chips.
Next Steps

time to pick all of the parts for the ic to work :D
Issues Faced

the chips i found are usually ball pads and there are so much stuff to route lol. i found a good contender with qfn package for 4 port with integrated usb cc negotiations too :D
